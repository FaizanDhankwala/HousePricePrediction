# House Price Prediction Model Using Machine Learning

# Project Overview

This project focuses on the visualization of actual versus predicted prices using a scatter plot. The primary goal is to illustrate the performance of a predictive model by comparing the actual prices from the training dataset with the predicted prices generated by the model. This comparison provides valuable insights into the model's accuracy and areas where it may need improvement.

## Key Features

### Scatter Plot Visualization

The scatter plot is a powerful tool for visualizing the relationship between actual and predicted prices. It helps in assessing the performance of the predictive model in a clear and intuitive manner. The plot includes:

- **Actual Prices (X-axis)**: The horizontal axis represents the actual prices from the training dataset. These are the true values that the model aims to predict.
- **Predicted Prices (Y-axis)**: The vertical axis represents the prices predicted by the model based on the training data. These values are generated by the model during the training process.
- **Data Points**: Each point on the scatter plot corresponds to an individual data point in the training set, showing the actual price versus the predicted price for that particular instance.

### Insights Provided

#### Model Performance Evaluation

- **Closeness to the Line \( y = x \)**: In an ideal scenario, all points would lie exactly on the line \( y = x \), indicating perfect predictions. The closer the points are to this line, the more accurate the model's predictions.
- **Spread of Points**: A tight cluster of points around the line \( y = x \) indicates high accuracy and low prediction error, while a wide spread suggests higher errors and potential issues with the model.

#### Error Analysis

- **Deviation from the Line**: Points that deviate significantly from the line \( y = x \) highlight discrepancies between the actual and predicted prices. These deviations can be used to identify patterns of overestimation or underestimation by the model.
- **Pattern Identification**: By analyzing the scatter plot, users can identify systematic errors, such as consistent overpricing or underpricing, which can inform further refinement of the model.

#### Model Improvement

- **Identifying Weaknesses**: The scatter plot can reveal specific ranges or types of data where the model performs poorly. This insight can guide additional data collection, feature engineering, or adjustments to the model architecture.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly updating and reviewing the scatter plot as the model evolves ensures that improvements are tracked and that any new issues are promptly addressed.

## Example Visualization Code

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create the scatter plot for visualizing actual vs predicted prices using Python and Matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data (replace with actual data)
Y_train = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]  # Actual prices
training_data_prediction = [110, 210, 290, 410, 490]  # Predicted prices

# Scatter plot of actual prices vs predicted prices
plt.scatter(Y_train, training_data_prediction)
plt.xlabel("Actual Prices")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Prices")
plt.title("Actual Price vs Predicted Price")
plt.show()

```
## Lets break it down!
# Importing Matplotlib
# The matplotlib.pyplot module is imported to enable plotting functionalities.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Defining Data
# Two lists, Y_train and training_data_prediction, are defined to represent the actual and predicted prices, respectively.
# In practice, these lists would be populated with the actual data from the model.
Y_train = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]  # Actual prices
training_data_prediction = [110, 210, 290, 410, 490]  # Predicted prices

# Creating the Scatter Plot
# This line creates the scatter plot with actual prices on the x-axis and predicted prices on the y-axis.
plt.scatter(Y_train, training_data_prediction)
# This line sets the label for the x-axis.
plt.xlabel("Actual Prices")
# This line sets the label for the y-axis.
plt.ylabel("Predicted Prices")
# This line sets the title of the plot.
plt.title("Actual Price vs Predicted Price")

# Displaying the Plot
# plt.show() is called to display the scatter plot.
plt.show()
